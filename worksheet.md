# Virtual Reality workshop for National Theatre of Scotland
***Create a virtual reality tableau of an imaginary space that combines images, words, and other virtual objects.***

In the first play of Interference, *Metaverse*, a mother meets her daughter in a virtual space, to help her with her homework.
Create your own virtual space that you'd use to work, play, relax, or solves a problem you have.

What would be the perfect virtual space to hang out with friends?
If you hate noisy train stations, design a virtual space you would escape to.
A perfect holiday space.
A space for watching films with friends.
Somewhere to go if you feel anxious.

### Set the scene

1. Find an 'equirectangular' photo that suits your space. You'll find lots here: <https://crg.st/equil>
2. Use the download icon to save the photo to your computer
3. Go the project page - <https://glitch.com/~webvr-space>
4. Click the `Remix your own` button to make your own copy of the project
5. Click on the `assets` folder on the left hand side. Upload your photo by dragging and dropping it.
6. Use the `Copy` button to copy the URL (address) of the image you uploaded
7. Change the `<a-sky>` line of code, replace the address in `src` with the one you've just copied.
8. Use the `Show Live` button to see your updated VR scene


### Add in words
What words or phrases describe how you feel in this space?
For example:
*Carefree Calm Gloomy Repulsed Lazy Rejuvenated
Focussed Edgy Sociable Focussed Safe Stressed Amused*

1. Create a list of 5 words, and then add them into the space as `<a-text>` objects
2. You can change the `position` and `rotation` of each bit of text
3. Use different fonts that match the mood. These fonts are built-in to A-Frame: `robotoon` `aileronsemibold` `dejavu`
`exo2boldxo2semibold` `kelsonsans` `monoidillavr` `sourcecodepro`

You can use a visual inspector tool to view and remix your space.
Just press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> on any A-Frame scene to open up the Inspector.


### Add in sounds, shapes, and other objects
You can also add sounds into your space. (Although, this doesn't work as well on mobile browsers).
Here's an example of a project that uses sound - <https://glitch.com/~webvr-space-sound>. You can remix it to use your own sounds or music.
<https://freesound.org/> is a great website for free sounds.

Use the aframe website <https://aframe.io/docs> to find out about adding other shapes and 3D objects.
