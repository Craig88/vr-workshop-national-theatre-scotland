# VR Workshop for National Theatre of Scotland

**A hands on Virtual Reality workshop for the National Theatre of Scotland.**

This workshop accompanies *Interference* directed by Cora Bissett - a trilogy of plays all exploring a futuristic world and our relationship with technology. This is performed in a non-traditional space and promises to be a really exciting and engaging performance. You can find out more [on the NTS website](https://www.nationaltheatrescotland.com/production/interference/).

The workshop was created as part of First Nights, a programme that engages groups of people, giving them the opportunity to experience a National Theatre of Scotland production. They get to attend performances and take part in specially designed workshops breaking down some of the social and psychological barriers that may have prevented them from engaging with theatre and the arts previously.

### Workshop description
> Learn how to create your own Virtual Reality world. You'll use A-Frame to remix your own virtual reality experience using code, then test it out and share it with your friends. You can even share it online for the world to see. No previous coding experience is needed, and you'll be provided with all the tools you need to let you explore VR. This workshop is a fun way to be creative with technology.
